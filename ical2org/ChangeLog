	* tz.py (assign_tz): Break out the logic for assigning a time zone
	to a datetime so we can reuse it when not normalizing on UTC.

	* org.py (OrgTreeFormatter.format_event): Include the UID property
	of the event in the output, if we have it.

	* filter.py (by_date_range): Use the local time zone for date
	range comparison, instead of UTC.  This lets us handle DST
	correctly, since we can convert the recurrance time to the DST
	value *after* exploding the recurrance rule instead of before.

	* calendars.py (Calendar.get_events): Let the filter deal with
	normalizing the data so we only do it in one place.
